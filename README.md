# BmOS
Bmo Operating System :3

For now I don't know how slow it will be if I store the frames in a vector, so I'm using an array.
Downside is that you have to go to 
```
BmOS.h
```
and manually modify the code to fit your width and height, including the frame variable too.

run in root of the folder:
```
make clean
make
./BmoOuput
```
